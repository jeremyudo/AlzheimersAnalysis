## Introduction 
Our team decided to analyze the Alzheimer’s Disease dataset created by Rabei El Kharoua on Kaggle. We decided to proceed with this topic since Alzheimer’s is a very common illness without a cure that affects millions of people both directly and indirectly. This data set includes data from 2,149 patients and has 34 variables.
